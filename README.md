# wsn-power-simulation
University project simulating the dynamic power management in Wireless Sensor Networks

## Installation
When compiling the code in the projects, you need to change the `CONTIKI` variable to where the contiki-ng folder is found for you.
In the commited file the relative path is set to ../../contiki-ng because the os is in the two folders above. So you just need to adjust this according to your folder structure.
